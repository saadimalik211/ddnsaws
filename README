# Dynamic DNS Using AWS Route 53 (ddnsaws)

`ddnsaws` is a tool that automates the process of keeping a DNS record updated with a server's most current IP address. This script is especially useful in environments with dynamic public IP addresses. It's Dockerized and uses AWS Boto3 for interacting with AWS services.

## Features

- **Automatic IP detection:** Regularly checks the public IP address of your server and updates AWS Route 53 if it changes.
- **Docker support:** The tool is containerized for easy deployment and consistent run environments.
- **AWS Boto3 integration:** Interacts seamlessly with AWS services, ensuring smooth operation within the AWS ecosystem.
- **Error handling and logging:** Provides efficient logging mechanisms for easy troubleshooting and operation monitoring.

## Prerequisites

Before you deploy `ddnsaws`, ensure the following requirements are met:

- Docker and Docker Compose are installed on your server.
- An AWS account with the necessary permissions for Route 53 access.
- A domain managed via AWS Route 53.

## Setup and Deployment

### 1. Clone the Repository
